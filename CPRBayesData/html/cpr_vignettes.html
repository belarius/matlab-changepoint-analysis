</pre><h2>Task Acquisition: Simultaneous Chains<a name="2"></a></h2><p>Jensen and colleagues (2013) reported the results of a transfer of learning between two tasks, one of which was the "simultaneous chain" (or "simchain") task (Terrace, 2005). Jensen (Submitted) reanalyzed some data from that study using the CPR algorithm with a binomial model.</p><p>The following example was presented in detail:</p><pre class="codeinput">d = [1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;0;1;0;1;1;1;0];
[M,P,stats] = CPRBayes((d),<span class="string">'binomial'</span>);

M =

     0
     7
    40


P =

    0.1875
    0.8676

</pre><p>The model 'M' vector encodes the segmentation of 'd', with a segment 'i', covering the range [M(i)+1:M(i+1)]. In each segment 'i', the estimated parameters are encoded in the parameter vector 'P'. A binomial model is used, so these consist of a single value per segment, the estimated probability.</p><p>Additionally, the structure 'stats' contains detailed information about the analysis. Notable among these are 'stats.seg_numer' and 'stats.seg_denom', which report the numerator and denominator of the Bayes Factors for each stage of segmentation, on a log scale. This allows the individual steps of the algorithm to be traced without requiring all of the BFs to be calculated again. For example, here are the BFs for the first segmentation step:</p><pre class="codeinput">BF = exp(stats.seg_numer(:,1)+stats.seg_denom(:,1));
area(BF)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="cpr_vignettes_01.png" alt=""> <p>These values already take into consideration the act of averaging and the Schwarz-Bayes correction for small sample bias, so their sum provides the overall Bayes Factor used to evaluate whether to identify a change-point. Since the analysis used a default criteron of 10 (which we can see because stats.threshold == 10), and since sum(BF) = 81.3977, we may say that there is good evidence for a change-point.</p><p>The highest peak in BF is selected as the cp, which in this case corresponds to the interval between trial 7 and trial 8. Addtionally, because BF is taken to estimate the sampling distribution of the distribution of possible change-points, it is also used to set a confidence interval for the change-point. 'stats.conf' indicates the confidence interval (95% by default), which is estimated to lie between 5.049 and 14.996, a result of the positive skew in BF. Confidence intervals are reported in 'stats.conf_int'; the first and last rows are set to NaN because they correspond to the fenceposts M(1)=0 and M(end)=n. This confidence interval is approximately depicted in red below.</p><pre class="codeinput">area(BF)

In each trial, subjects made between 0 and 5 correct responses, with reward delivery only on trials where the 5th response was reached. change-points were used to determine the point at which subjects had learned the identity of each of the five presented stimuli. Columns in 'simchain_data' correspond to lists, while rows correspond to trials.</p><pre class="codeinput">d = simchain_data;

Put another way, if the animal makes 4 responses correctly, they are virtually guaranteed to make the 5th.</p><p>This can be seen in the histograms depicting the transition time from learning each item to learning the next, as determined using the CPR algorithm. Notice that 'messages' is set to 'off' to suppress the 125 resulting reports, and that 'weight' is used to rule out learning prior to informative feedback.</p><pre class="codeinput">subplot(1,1,1);

%% Data Analysis Vignettes
% Here, the analyses presented in Jensen (Submitted) are replicated in
% full, in order to showcase how the associated analyses were performed
% using this implementation of the CPR algorithm

load('cp_data.mat');

%% Task Acquisition: Simultaneous Chains
%
% Jensen and colleagues (2013) reported the results of a transfer of
% learning between two tasks, one of which was the "simultaneous chain"
% (or "simchain") task (Terrace, 2005). Jensen (Submitted) reanalyzed some
% data from that study using the CPR algorithm with a binomial model.
%
% The following example was presented in detail:
%

d = [1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;1;0;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;1;0;1;0;1;1;1;0];
[M,P,stats] = CPRBayes((d),'binomial');
M
P

%%
%
% The model 'M' vector encodes the segmentation of 'd', with a segment 'i',
% covering the range [M(i)+1:M(i+1)]. In each segment 'i', the estimated
% parameters are encoded in the parameter vector 'P'. A binomial model
% is used, so these consist of a single value per segment, the estimated
% probability.
%
% Additionally, the structure 'stats' contains detailed information about
% the analysis. Notable among these are 'stats.seg_numer' and
% 'stats.seg_denom', which report the numerator and denominator of the
% Bayes Factors for each stage of segmentation, on a log scale. This allows
% the individual steps of the algorithm to be traced without requiring all
% of the BFs to be calculated again. For example, here are the BFs for the
% first segmentation step:
%

BF = exp(stats.seg_numer(:,1)+stats.seg_denom(:,1));
area(BF)

%%
%
% These values already take into consideration the act of averaging and the
% Schwarz-Bayes correction for small sample bias, so their sum provides the
% overall Bayes Factor used to evaluate whether to identify a change-point.
% Since the analysis used a default criteron of 10 (which we can see
% because stats.threshold == 10), and since sum(BF) = 81.3977, we may say
% that there is good evidence for a change-point.
%
% The highest peak in BF is selected as the cp, which in this case
% corresponds to the interval between trial 7 and trial 8. Addtionally,
% because BF is taken to estimate the sampling distribution of the
% distribution of possible change-points, it is also used to set a
% confidence interval for the change-point. 'stats.conf' indicates the
% confidence interval (95% by default), which is estimated to lie between
% 5.049 and 14.996, a result of the positive skew in BF. Confidence
% intervals are reported in 'stats.conf_int'; the first and last rows are
% set to NaN because they correspond to the fenceposts M(1)=0 and M(end)=n.
% This confidence interval is approximately depicted in red below.
%

% Simchain data originally reported by Jensen and colleagues from one
% subject are  below, consisting of 25 sessions of 40 trials each. In each
% trial, subjects made between 0 and 5 correct responses, with reward
% delivery only on trials where the 5th response was reached. change-points
% were used to determine the point at which subjects had learned the
% identity of each of the five presented stimuli. Columns in
% 'simchain_data' correspond to lists, while rows correspond to trials.
%

d = simchain_data;
area(mean(d,2))

%%
%
% Plotted as a learning curve, this subject makes considerable progress, on
% average, reaching approximately 4 out of 5 items into the list by the end
% of the session. This is very misleading, however, because this average
% does not resemble any of the individual sessions.

%
% As the above plot shows, sometimes little progress is made, while
% learning occurs early in other cases. A more subtle result is that it is
% very uncommon for the subject to get 4 responses correct. Put another
% way, if the animal makes 4 responses correctly, they are virtually
% guaranteed to make the 5th.
%
% This can be seen in the histograms depicting the transition time from
% learning each item to learning the next, as determined using the CPR
% algorithm. Notice that 'messages' is set to 'off' to suppress the 125
% resulting reports, and that 'weight' is used to rule out learning prior
